Judge, John W.Sexton said: _'[Finola Cahill's sample collection] is an exceptional series of poems in a non-tangential surrealist register, each so well-crafted that they excel as vehicles of metaphor. These pieces mock so perfectly from their hidden, secret hearts, that the reader is forced into wakefulness. A poem that reveals itself by hiding itself, like the inversions in a cubist painting, is an admirable achievement. This collection is full of them.'_\n\n * _Longlisted_ - The London Magazine Poetry Prize 2025\n * [_Longlisted_ - The Rialto Nature and Place Poetry Competition 2025](https://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/2025/05/27/nature-and-place-winners-2025-announced/)\n * [_Longlisted_ - The National Poetry Competition 2024](https://poetrysociety.org.uk/competitions/national-poetry-competition/) \n * [_Longlisted_ - The Rialto Nature and Place Poetry Competition 2024](https://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/2024/06/03/nature-and-place-2024-winners-announced/)\n * _Longlisted_ - The Brotherton Prize 2023\n * _Longlisted_ - Cheltenham Poetry Prize 2023, judged by Joseph Fasano\n * _Commended_ - Cathal Bui Poetry Competition 2023 \n * Awarded 2024 Tyrone Guthrie Centre Bursary from Mayo Arts Office\n * Selected for 2023 Irish Writers Centre Mentorship programme. _Generously sponsored by the Mayo Arts Office_ [See Press Article](https://westernpeople.ie/2023/06/08/ballina-writer-selected-for-national-mentoring-programme/)\n * Arts Council Agility Award round 2 recipient 2023\n\n ### Fiction Awards\n * [_Shortlisted_ - Máirtín Crawford Short Story Award 2024](https://belfastbookfestival.com/mairtin-crawford-award/shortlist-2024), judged by Wendy Erskine and Lucy Caldwell\n * [_Shortlisted_ - Bath Short Story Award 2024](https://www.bathshortstoryaward.org/2024/07/22/shortlist-2024/)\n ## Press\n * [Ballina woman wins major prize at Listowel Writers Week](https://westernpeople.ie/news/ballina-woman-wins-major-prize-at-listowel-writers-week_arid-19082.html)\n * [Mayo writer scoops prestigious award at top Irish writers festival](https://www.con-telegraph.ie/2024/05/31/mayo-writer-scoops-prestigious-award-at-top-irish-writers-festival/)\n * [Mayo Woman Claims Top Poetry Prize](https://westernpeople.ie/2023/11/11/mayo-woman-claims-top-poetry-prize/)\n [Winners of the Waterford Poetry Prize 2023 Announced](https://waterford-news.ie/2023/10/31/winners-of-the-waterford-poetry-prize-2023-announced/)\n * [Mayo writer among winners](https://www.con-telegraph.ie/2023/11/02/mayo-writer-among-winners-in-the-waterford-poetry-prize-2023/)\n * [Ballina woman claims first place at Waterford Poetry Prize](https://www.midwestradio.ie/index.php/news/71770-ballina-woman-claims-first-place-at-waterford-poetry-prize)\n * [Ballina writer and musician wins prestigious award](https://www.mayonews.ie/news/local-news/1339105/ballina-writer-and-musician-wins-prestigious-award.html)\n * [Art in the blood: Ellen Quinn Banville and Finola Cahill](https://www.businesspost.ie/more-life-arts/art-in-the-blood-ellen-quinn-banville-and-finola-cahill/)\n * [Ballina Writer selected for National Mentoring Programme](https://westernpeople.ie/2023/06/08/ballina-writer-selected-for-national-mentoring-programme/)\n ## Workshops\n * Stinging Fly Poetry Summer School _2024_\n * Seamus Heaney Summer School _2023_ \n * Stinging Fly Fiction Summer School _2023_\n * Stinging Fly Poetry Summer School _2024_\n * Stinging Fly Six Month Workshop _2023/2024_\n"
