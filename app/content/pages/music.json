  "content": "# PEMBROKE\n\n ______________________________________________________\n\n _'AT SEA IS MAKING WAVES AS A WORD-OF-MOUTH SUCCESS' - The Sunday Business Post_\n\n Ellen Quinn Banville and Finola Cahill first met on a rainy Dublin evening in a friend's apartment on Upper Pembroke street. Years later they rekindled their friendship in Paris, France and went on to start Pembroke in early 2015.\n\nTheir sound reflects their differing and diverse influences, from blues to pop to soul to lyrical folk.Their debut album, At Sea, was released in February 2018. Made in the forest just outside of Paris, the album boasts a roster of extremely talented guest artists, lending to a boisterous, textured, and rich sound. The songs are built upon a folk foundation of Cahill's evocative lyrics and acoustic guitar lines but filled out with big band horns and percussion, country strings and the soaring range and raw vulnerability of Quinn Banville's vocals.\n\nTheir first tour of the UK & Ireland in August 2016 included a Sofar Session in London, a sold out gig at The Workman's Club, Dublin, and a number of interesting venues in Galway and West Cork. They have gone on to play shows across France, the UK and Ireland. They released their album in The Grand Social, Dublin on the 21st of February, 2018. They were invited to play the Music Trail at Other Voices in 2018. \n\nFor further details, vidoes, and streaming links visit [www.pembroke-music.com](https://www.pembroke-music.com)"
