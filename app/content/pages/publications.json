Judge, John W.Sexton said: _'[Finola Cahill's sample collection] is an exceptional series of poems in a non-tangential surrealist register, each so well-crafted that they excel as vehicles of metaphor. These pieces mock so perfectly from their hidden, secret hearts, that the reader is forced into wakefulness. A poem that reveals itself by hiding itself, like the inversions in a cubist painting, is an admirable achievement. This collection is full of them.'_\n\n * Selected for 2023 Irish Writers Centre Mentorship programme. _Generously sponsored by the Mayo Arts Office_ [See Press Article](https://westernpeople.ie/2023/06/08/ballina-writer-selected-for-national-mentoring-programme/)\n * Arts Council Agility Award round 2 recipient 2023\n\n ### Workshops\n * Seamus Heaney Summer School _2023_ \n * Stinging Fly Fiction Summer School _2023_\n * Stinging Fly Six Month Workshop _2023/2023_\n"
