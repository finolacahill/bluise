Judge, John W.Sexton said:\n ```'Women’s Work is an exceptional series of poems in a non-tangential surrealist register, each so well-crafted that they excel as vehicles of metaphor. These pieces mock so perfectly from their hidden, secret hearts, that the reader is forced into wakefulness. A poem that reveals itself by hiding itself, like the inversions in a cubist painting, is an admirable achievement. This collection is full of them.'```\n"
